# Popular Movies
Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. This project allows users to discover the most popular movies playing. This is a part of my android nanodegree program from Udacity.
 The movies are being fetched using the APIs of : www.themoviedb.org

You can enter your API_KEY in app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml
